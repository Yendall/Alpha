Main Aim:
---------------------------------------------
Alpha is an application targeting anxiety and
stress links in both males and females.
Alpha combines audio visual stimuli, mood 
analysis, quotation generation and 
meditation techniques to stimulate and 
educate the user on how to defeat anxiety
and stress in their day to day life.

Technical Notes:
---------------------------------------------
Alpha uses media streaming from external 
sources for it's music component. In Alpha
2.0, it will use Cloud streaming from Amazon
and Firebase data fetching. Each piece of
data is a JSON tree which is parsed once at
runtime and inserted into a Singleton which 
will become a database in Alpha 2.0.

Functionality:
--------------------------------------------
Each page will provide obvious UI choices
which guide the user.
